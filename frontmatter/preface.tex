\chapter[Preface]{Preface}\label{chap:Preface}

These notes and exercise solutions are based off the work that I have put in for studying for \courseNumber - \courseTitle while attending \courseUni. 
Anyone is more than free to share these notes, however I cannot personally guarantee the full correctness of the notes or solutions. There are likely 
errors introduced into the notes (and likely by mine own mistake). If you find any errors, please do not hesitate to reach out -- I am more than happy 
to correct the notes and distribute a revised version.
