\chapter[Preface]{Preface}\label{chap:Preface}

These notes are based off the work that I, Quinn Winters, personally put into while undergoing the lectures and coursework at TU Munich.
In particular, there are possibly (in fact likely) many errors in these notes (and the associated homework assignments). Moreover 
some content is structured in ways slightly different from the original presentation from the lecturers. These notes should be 
taken to be supplemental study tools and by no means a replacement for actually taking the lecture and putting in the work for exercises.
