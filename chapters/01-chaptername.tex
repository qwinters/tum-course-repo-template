\Chapter{Example chapter}

Here is an example chapter that might have various different aspects of mathematics in it. For example, we might have a theorem that is really
important and deseriving of its own section like this:

\begin{Theorem}{Example theorem}
  The fundamental theorem of calculus states that if $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is an integrable function, and you give the function $F$ by
  \[
  F(x) = \int_{a}^x f(t)\;\dd t
  \], 
  then $\frac{\dd}{\dd x} F(x) = f(x) - f(a)$. 
\end{Theorem}
\begin{outline}
  \item Define the function $F$ as you would like it to be. 
  \item For each $x$ look at a neighborhood around $x$ and calculate the derivative using mean value theorem. 
  \item Shrink the neighborhood until you get the result.
\end{outline}
\begin{prf}[Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]
  Let $F(x)$ be the function as desired and fix $x \in (a, b]$. Then \ldots 
\end{prf}

For more on this proof, see the Wikipedia page \cite{ftc}.
